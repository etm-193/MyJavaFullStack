        <h4>Welcome to this, my "About me" page!</h4>
        <p>If I'm being honest, I don't like to write about myself, though I do like to write. Curious since, when I was a child 
            I hated writing and I was grading an average of a C in my Spanish class, which is my "lingua franca". 
            However, I started traveling outside of Puerto Rico, first to the US where I learned english in just a few months. Then later, on my first trip outside the states, 
            I realized my interest in languages. Learning other people's cultures and traditions brought a new fondness 
            to grammar & syntax and the beauty of searching to understand one another.  
        </p>

        <p>I graduated highschool to enroll in the University of Puerto Rico and five years later graduate from a Bachelor of Arts in pre-translation and a second concentration in Italian studies.</p>
