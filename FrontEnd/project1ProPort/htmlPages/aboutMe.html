        <h4>Welcome to this, my "About me" page!</h4>
        <p>
        My name is Ernesto J. Torres Martinez, I like to travel with my wife, play video games, learn new subjects, write stories and poetry. 
        Interestingly, as a child I used to loathe writing. It wasn't until 2018 that it became a real hobby, when I found myself inside a cot, trying to write a diary like story and
        poetry by the dimming light of my flashlight, during the recovery efforts of hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, my home.

            It's funny how life has small ironies like that. I never saw myself as an automotive technician or mechanically inclined whatsoever, nevertheless when I decided to join
            the US Army in 2015. My aptitude tests differed from that perspective and my plans to become a translator evaporated. Seven years later and I can say that I've filled multiple roles.
            Some as a mechanic, some as a quality specialist, others as logistic support, field service representative, and even a team leader or supervisor. Now I wish to embark on a new path, 
            a <a href="/FrontEnd/project1ProPort/htmlPages/journey.html">journey</a> to become a software developer.
